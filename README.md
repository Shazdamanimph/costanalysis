# Wastewater Surveillance Cost Analysis

## Overview

As wastewater surveillance networks expand in both scope and scale, understanding the true costs of operating and maintaining these systems is vital. Accurate cost data informs financial and economic evaluations that drive sustainable investments, strategic planning, and effective resource allocation. Historically, many wastewater surveillance programs have depended on emergency funding with little focus on long-term cost-effectiveness or marginal costs. Without detailed cost analysis, stakeholders lack the necessary information to optimize, responsibly scale during outbreaks, or sustain these programs when pathogen activity is low.

## Project Purpose

To address these challenges, the New York State Center of Excellence (NY COE) conducted a comprehensive preliminary cost analysis of wastewater surveillance activities. This project uses a micro-costing approach to estimate expenses across critical areas, such as:

- Personnel
- Facilities
- Laboratory equipment
- Consumables
- Software
- Administrative overhead
- Inter-agency collaboration
- Process optimization
- Ongoing monitoring infrastructure

The primary objective is to determine the unit cost per wastewater sample and evaluate the marginal cost of adding new pathogen targets a key component for understanding economies of scale in surveillance system design.

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Foundational Cost Framework

- Determined the optimal marginal cost per pathogen/target
- Established baseline cost per sample and analyzed economies of scale for adding new targets
- Collected complete data and began model development

### Phase 2: Cost Modeling Tools

Development of modeling tools to enable:

- **Estimation of Base and Core Activity Costs**: Across different network configurations
- **Sensitivity Analyses**: Including inflation and NY-specific variables
- **Scaling Scenarios:** For pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2, influenza, norovirus, hepatitis A, RSV, measles, and polio
- **Unit Cost Comparisons:** Between single-pathogen and multi-pathogen surveillance systems

## Key Analysis Questions

- **Optimal Marginal Cost Per Pathogen/Target:** What is the additional cost of monitoring each new pathogen or target?
- **Cost Per Sample:** How much does it cost to process a single wastewater sample?
- **Economies of Scale:** How do costs change as new targets are added?
- **Sensitivity Analysis:** How do costs shift with inflation or changes in network activities?
- **Pathogen-Specific Scenarios:** What are the costs of scaling up or down for various pathogens?
- **Single vs. Multi-Pathogen Surveillance:** What are the cost trade-offs?

## Goals and Impact

By thoroughly mapping the cost landscape of wastewater surveillance, this work aims to provide programs with the tools and data necessary for informed, fiscally responsible investment decisions. Our efforts support the transition of wastewater surveillance from a pandemic-driven innovation to a sustainable pillar of national and global disease monitoring systems, ensuring readiness for future infectious threats.
